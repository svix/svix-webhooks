# Feature requests

Raise an issue for these and tag it as an Enhancement. We love every idea. Please give us as much context on the why as possible.

# Features

We don't, yet, have a prescriptive roadmap laid out.

As a rule of thumb - if it fits with helping developers understand product usage, we'll generally like it.

If you are at all unsure, just raise it as an enhancement issue first, and we'll very quickly respond.
