# Svix Bridge Example Configuration

# Set the log level for the service. Supported: error, info, warn, debug, trace. Default: info
#log_level: "debug"

# The log format that all output will follow. Supported: default, json
#log_format: "json"

# Optional: configures an OTEL exporter forwarding spans to the specified collector
opentelemetry:
  address: "http://localhost:1234"
  sample_ratio: 0.5
  # Optional: default "svix-bridge"
  service_name: "my-bridge"


# The host/port to bind to for incoming HTTP requests.
# Optional: default "0.0.0.0:5000"
# http_listen_address: "0.0.0.0:5000"

# Receivers are HTTP endpoints that can have webhooks sent to them.
# When a webhook is POST'ed to a matching URL, it is (optionally) verified,
# (optionally) transformed via a js function, then forwarded to an "output."
#
# Inputs types are "webhook" which allows you to configure a verification scheme
# (either "svix" or "none") or "svix-webhook" which is a shorthand version.
#
# There is also a "svix-message-poller" input type which will poll a polling endpoint
# rather than waiting for incoming messages.
#
# ```
#   input:
#     type: "webhook"
#     path_id: "long-hand"
#     verification:
#       type: "svix"
#       endpoint_secret: "whsec_XXXXX="
#   # same as...
#   input:
#     type: "svix-webhook"
#     path_id: "shorthand"
#     endpoint_secret: "whsec_XXXXX="
# ```
#
# The `path_id` in webhook and svix-webhook inputs represents the trailing
# path segment that will connect to the given output.
# For example, running bridge with the HTTP listen address set to
# `localhost:5000`, the above examples would map to the following URLS:
# - http://localhost:5000/webhook/long-hand
# - http://localhost:5000/webhook/shorthand
