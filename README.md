# Running the server

There are multiple ways to get the Svix server up running. Docker is probably the most common one, but you can choose the one that works best for you.

The Svix server is written in Rust ü¶Ä, which means you can compile it into a static library for a variety of targets. Please refer to the building from source section below for more information.

Please refer to the [server configuration](#server-configuration) section below for more information regarding the available settings.

## Deployment

### Docker

You can use the official Svix Docker image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/svix/svix-server). You can either use the `latest` tag, or one of [the versioned tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/svix/svix-server/tags) instead.

You can either use the example [docker-compose.yml](./server/docker-compose.yml) file with `docker compose` (easiest), `docker swarm` (advanced), or run the container standalone.

#### With Docker Compose

This alternative is the easiest because it will also boot up and configure `redis` and `postgresql`.

This assumes you have Docker Compose v2 installed.

```
cd server
docker compose up
```

#### Standalone container

Running a standalone container is slightly more advanced, as it requires you to set some environment variables and have them pointing to your `redis` and `postgres` instances.
You can pass individual environment variables to docker using the `-e` flag, or just create a file like [development.env](./server/svix-server/development.env) and use the `--env-file` flag like in the example below:

```
docker run \
  --name svix-server \
  -p 8071:8071 \
  --env-file development.env \
  svix/svix-server
```

### Pre-compiled binaries

Pre-compiled binaries are available for released versions in the [releases section](https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks/releases).

### Building from source

The Svix server is written in Rust ü¶Ä and requires a Rust build environment.

If you already have one, you just need to run `cargo build`, otherwise, please please refer to the [Svix server README](./server/#readme) for more information about building the server from source.

## Runtime dependencies

The server requires the following runtime dependencies to work correctly:

- A PostgreSQL server - for the storage of events.
- An *optional* Redis server version 6.2.0 or higher - for the task queue and cache.

## Redis/Valkey Considerations
### Persistence
Please note that it's recommended to enable persistence in Redis so that tasks are persisted across Redis server restarts and upgrades.

### Eviction Policy
Please ensure that your Redis instances are configured to not evict keys without explicit `expire` policies set. This means that `maxmemory-policy` should be set to `noeviction` or to any of the available `volatile-` policies. See Redis/Valkey documentation for further information.

## Server configuration

There are three ways to configure `svix-server`: environment vars, `.env` file, and a configuration file.

### Configuration file

You can put a file called `config.toml` in the current working directory of `svix-server` and it will automatically pick it up.
You can take a look at the example file for more information and a full list of supported settings: [config.toml](./server/svix-server/config.default.toml).

Here's a quick example of the most important configurations:

```toml
# The JWT secret for authentication - should be secret and securely generated
jwt_secret = "8KjzRXrKkd9YFcNyqLSIY8JwiaCeRc6WK4UkMnSW"

# The DSN for the database. Only postgres is currently supported.
db_dsn = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@pgbouncer/postgres"

# The DSN for redis (can be left empty if not using redis)
redis_dsn = "redis://redis:6379"

# What kind of message queue to use.
queue_type = "redis"
```


### Environment (variables or `.env`)

Alternatively, you can configure `svix-server` by setting the equivalent environment variables for each of the supported settings. The environment variables can either be passed directly or by setting them in a `.env` file.

The environment variables have the name name as the config names, but they are all upper case and are prefixed with `SVIX_`.

For example, the above example configuration would look like this if it was passed in the env:

```
# The JWT secret for authentication - should be secret and securely generated
SVIX_JWT_SECRET = "8KjzRXrKkd9YFcNyqLSIY8JwiaCeRc6WK4UkMnSW"

# The DSN for the database. Only postgres is currently supported.
SVIX_DB_DSN = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@pgbouncer/postgres"

# The DSN for redis (can be left empty if not using redis)
SVIX_REDIS_DSN = "redis://redis:6379"

# What kind of message queue to use.
SVIX_QUEUE_TYPE = "redis"
```

### OpenTelemetry

You may send tracing information to the OpenTelemetry Collector which allows forwarding trace events to a number of external applications/services such as DataDog, Jaeger, NewRelic, Prometheus, Sentry, Signoz, and Zipkin.

You can see more in [these instructions](./OpenTelemetry.md).

### Connection Pool Size

The `db_pool_max_size` configuration parameter controls the maximum allowed size of the connection pool for PostgreSQL. This value defaults to a max size of 100, but you can potentially increase application performance significantly by increasing this value. You may need to consider Postgres and PGBouncer configuration parameters as well when tuning these parameters.

The `redis_pool_max_size` parameter controls the maximum size of each Svix instance's Redis connection pool. Its default is 100. Note that only redis _queuing_ leverages connection pooling -- caching is fully asynchronous and so does not otherwise benefit from pooling. Therefore, you probably won't need to tune this parameter.

### SSRF Attacks and Internal IP Addresses
To prevent SSRF attacks, message dispatches to internal IP addresses are blocked by default. However we understand that this doesn't meet the needs of every user say, for example, the service can only be accessed internally. To bypass these restrictions, see the `whitelist_subnets` configuration option, which accepts an array of CIDR-notation subnets to allow messages to be dispatched to.

### Webhook signature scheme (symmetric vs asymmetric)

To ensure the security and integrity of messages, Svix signs all webhook messages prior to sending.
Svix supports two types of signature schemes: symmetric (pre-shared key) and asymmetric (public key).

Symmetric signatures are significantly faster (~50x for signing, and ~160x for verifying), and are much simpler (which makes verification easier for your customers), though they require the usage of a pre-shared key per endpoint (endpoint secret) in order to work. Asymmetric signatures on the other hand only require sharing a public key with your customers (not secret).

Because of the above, using symmetric keys is both recommended and the Svix default. Using them is documented in the [verifying signatures section of the docs](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual).

However, in some scenarios it may be beneficial to use asymmetric signatures, which is why they too are supported. For more information please refer to the [asymmetric signatures section](#asymmetric-signatures) below.

## Authentication

Use valid JWTs generated with the correct secret as `Bearer`.

E.g:
```
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN_HERE>
```

Either generate one using
```
svix-server jwt generate
```

Or if you are generating your own, make sure to use `org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu` as the `sub` field, and `H256` as the algorithm.


Example valid JWT for the secret `x` (so you can see the structure):
```js
// JWT: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE2NTUxNDA2MzksImV4cCI6MTk3MDUwMDYzOSwibmJmIjoxNjU1MTQwNjM5LCJpc3MiOiJzdml4LXNlcnZlciIsInN1YiI6Im9yZ18yM3JiOFlkR3FNVDBxSXpwZ0d3ZFhmSGlyTXUifQ.USMuIPrqsZTSj3kyWupCzJO9eyQioBzh5alGlvRbrbA
// Structure (when decoded):
{
  "iat": 1655140639,
  "exp": 1970500639,
  "nbf": 1655140639,
  "iss": "svix-server",
  "sub": "org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu"
}
```

### Using a different signing algorithm

As mentioned above, the default algorithm for signing JWTs is `HS256`. You can select a different algorithm by setting the `jwt_algorithm` config to one of these supported values: `HS384`, `HS512`, `RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`, or `EdDSA`.

## Operational (incoming) webhooks

Operational webhooks are webhooks that you can subscribe to in order to get notified of important events occurring on the svix-server. The list of supported events is available in [the webhooks section of the API reference](https://api.svix.com/docs#tag/Webhooks).

The operational webhooks utilize Svix, and are controlled by a special account service account with the following ID: `org_00000000000SvixManagement00`.

The first step is to turn it on by setting the `operational_webhook_address` config to point to your Svix server. The most common value for this setting is `http://127.0.0.1:8071`, though it may be different based on your specific setup.

The above step enables operational webhooks on this instance, and the next step is to enable it for your specific organization. As mentioned above, operational webhooks use a normal Svix account behind the scenes, so we'll first need to get the authentication token for this account. To do this you should run:

```
svix-server jwt generate org_00000000000SvixManagement00
```

This will give you a special JWT to access the operational webhooks account which is different to the normal JWT you use when interacting with Svix. Let's assume for example that the JWT it returned was `op_webhook_token_123`.

To enable operational webhooks for a specific account we need to first create an application for it in the service account (remember: operational webhooks just use Svix behind the scenes). We'll use the default Svix account as an example: `org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu`.

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8071/api/v1/app/' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer op_webhook_token_123' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "name": "Operational webhook for default org",
        "uid": "org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu"
    }'
```

This is it, we now have operational webhooks enabled for the default account. The only thing left is adding an endpoint where the operational webhooks are going to be sent to. For example:

```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.eu.svix.com/api/v1/app/org_23rb8YdGqMT0qIzpgGwdXfHirMu/endpoint/' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "url": "https://operational-webhook-destination.com/webhook/",
        "filterTypes": [
          ‚Äúendpoint.updated‚Äù,
          ‚Äúendpoint.deleted‚Äù
        ],
    }'
```

Note how we use the org ID of the default account as the `app_id` (or rather `uid` in this case), when creating an endpoint.

That's it. You should now have working operational webhooks. If you ever want to create a new endpoint, or modify an existing endpoint, you just need to generate a JWT for the service account, and then use the JWT like you would use any other Svix account.

## Asymmetric signatures

As mentioned above, symmetric signatures are recommended. However, please read the following instructions on setting up asymmetric signatures if you have determined that asymmetric signatures are what you need.

### Configuring the keys

By default, the Svix server generates symmetric secrets for endpoints, which in turn means messages will be signed with symmetric keys. To change this default, set the `default_signature_type` config to `ed25519` as follows:

```toml
default_signature_type = "ed25519"
```

Additionally, no matter what the default is set to, you can still override it by explicitly setting a key on an endpoint.
To set a symmetric key, set the endpoint secret to a secret prefixed with `whsec_`, such as `whsec_51TKyHBy5KFY1Ab98GQ8V60BkWnejkWy`.
To set an asymmetric key, set the endpoint secret to a **valid** ed25519 base64 encoded private key prefixed with `whsk_` such as: `whsk_6Xb/dCcHpPea21PS1N9VY/NZW723CEc77N4rJCubMbfVKIDij2HKpMKkioLlX0dRqSKJp4AJ6p9lMicMFs6Kvg==`.

Please note, that the expected private key structure is: `whsk_${base64(private_key + public_key)}`.

For testing purposes, new asymmetric key pairs can be generated using the following command:
```bash
$ svix-server asymmetric-key generate

Secret key: whsk_6Xb/dCcHpPea21PS1N9VY/NZW723CEc77N4rJCubMbfVKIDij2HKpMKkioLlX0dRqSKJp4AJ6p9lMicMFs6Kvg==
Public key: whpk_1SiA4o9hyqTCpIqC5V9HUakiiaeACeqfZTInDBbOir4=
```

### Signature scheme

Svix uses `ed25519(m)` for signing the webhook messages, and it constructs `m` the same way as it does for the symmetric signatures.

When verifying the message you should also ensure that the timestamp is recent enough in order to limit the potential of replay attacks as noted in [the symmetric verification docs](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/why).

## Shutting down the server

To support graceful shutdown on the server, all running tasks are finished before shutting down on a SIGINT/SIGTERM. This usually takes less than ten seconds.

# Differences to the Svix hosted service

One of our main goals with open sourcing the Svix dispatcher is ease of use. The hosted Svix service, however, is quite complex due to our scale and the infrastructure it requires. This complexity is not useful for the vast majority of people and would make this project much harder to use and much more limited.
This is why this code has been adjusted before being released, and some of the features, optimizations, and behaviors supported by the hosted dispatcher are not yet available in this repo. With that being said, other than some known incompatibilities, the internal Svix test suite passes. This means they are already mostly compatible, and we are working hard on bringing them to full feature parity.

# Redis task queue DLQ

In case of repeated internal errors when processing a task, a task may end up in the dead letter queue (DLQ).

Redis does not include built in support for DLQs, therefore when using the Redis queue backend, Svix manages its own DLQ. It's therefore important to monitor the DLQ depth to ensure that it's always empty. You can do that using the `svix.queue.depth_dlq` metric. Any non-zero values indicate that there are tasks in the DLQ that should be addressed.

To redrive the DLQ once the error conditions have ended, you can make a POST request to `/api/v1/admin/redrive-dlq/`.
